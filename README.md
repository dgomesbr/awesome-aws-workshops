## End User Computing

_Today's workforce is increasingly mobile. They're working remotely, on the go, and moving from one project to the next.
And, they're collaborating across borders, time zones, and organizations. We built AWS End User Computing (EUC) services
to give you the agility to respond to the changing needs of your workforce._

unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your
workloads dictate, not the other way around._

infrastructure as just code. You can author it with any code editor,
check it into a version control system, and review the files with team
members before deploying into production._
